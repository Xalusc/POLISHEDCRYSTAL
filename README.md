# POKéMON POLISHED CRYSTAL

This is a modification of the [Pokémon Polished Crystal ROM Hack](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal) by [rangi](https://github.com/Rangi42).
It's essentially the exact same game, but names have been restored to the Gen 2 naming convention.
This means that Pokémon names, characters, locations, items, stats, and some other words have been changed to ALL CAPS.
Here's a few examples (original Polished Crystal on the left, this version on the right):

# Original README
This is a custom Pokémon game based on [the Pokémon Crystal disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal).

My goal is to create what the title says: an improved, polished version of Pokémon Crystal. It fixes bugs, takes into account the official game changes since 2001, and adds some new ideas of my own. Many features restore what was removed from R/B/Y, or original to HG/SS.

I've had vague plans to make a Pokémon game for years. I'm very impressed by the effort that's gone into disassembling Pokémon Crystal and making the code so well-organized. Thanks to making it open-source (and to the ROM hackers that inspired me), I'm finally making this game a reality.

> There are many ways to create games but the way we work at Game Freak may be a little different from other companies. That is, we constantly change and tweak what we have come up with. To make a fun game even more fun and polish it up, we take what we have made and start thinking about it from scratch. And to make the game the most fun to play we make endless changes and tweaks no matter how long it takes. It may not be the best way, but I think these tweaks are important to make our games fun and better.

## Download and Play

The current beta version is **3.0.0**. It has some incomplete original content and known bugs, but it's playable from start to finish. Download the [nightly release](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta) to get the very latest ROM, up-to-date with the `master` code branch.

The most recent official version is [2.2.0](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal/releases/tag/v2.2.0) as of September 20, 2016. [The changelog](CHANGELOG.md) lists all changes since then. I recommend playing the 3.0.0 beta instead.
